# What ?
Astar is a Nano and Vim-like TUI text editor based on the [Kilo Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html), It is meant to be easily configurable, incredibly light and user-friendly. It'll be available by default on the [Titanium OS]().

## Why ?
It's fuuuuuun !

# How does it run ?
For the time, it's only available on Unix terminal, so if you are on Windows, you will need to install [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/wsl/install).

Once you have a Unix terminal, just get the latest release, and then run:
```bash 
./astar <your_file.xyz> 
```
or 
```bash 
./astar 
```

Nice, it's workiin' !!
